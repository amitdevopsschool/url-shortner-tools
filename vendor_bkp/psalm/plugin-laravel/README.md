## Overview
This [Psalm](https://github.com/vimeo/psalm) plugin brings static analysis and type support to projects using Laravel. Our goal is to find as many type-related
 bugs as possible, therefore increasing developer productivity and application health. Find bugs without the overhead
 of writing tests!

See [releases](https://github.com/psalm/psalm-plugin-laravel/releases) for more details about supported PHP, Laravel and Psalm versions.


## Quickstart

### Step 1: Install

```bash
composer require --dev psalm/plugin-laravel
./vendor/bin/psalm-plugin enable psalm/plugin-laravel
```

### Step 2: Configure
If you didn't use Psalm on the project before, you need to create a Psalm config:
```bash
./vendor/bin/psalm --init
```

### Step 3: Run ðŸš€
Run your usual Psalm command:
```bash
./vendor/bin/psalm
```

You can customize Psalm configuration using [XML config](https://psalm.dev/docs/running_psalm/configuration/)
and/or [cli parameters](https://psalm.dev/docs/running_psalm/command_line_usage/).

**Recommendation**: use [baseline file](https://psalm.dev/docs/running_psalm/dealing_with_code_issues/#using-a-baseline-file) and increase
`errorLevel` at least to `4`: this way you can catch more issues. Step by step set `errorLevel` to `1` and use Psalm and this plugin at full power ðŸš€.  


## How it works

Under the hood it just runs https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper and feeds the resultant stubs into Psalm, which can read PhpStorm meta stubs.

It also parses any database migrations it can find to try to understand property types in your database models.


## Psalm-Laravel-Plugin or Larastan?

Both! It's fine to use both tools at the same project: they use different approaches to analyze code, and thus you can find more bugs!
Psalm and PHPStan use almost same the syntax annotations, so you should not have any conflicts.
